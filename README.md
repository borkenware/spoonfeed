Generate beautiful documentation portals in seconds from easy-to-edit markdown files. Bundle your markdown files
into a Preact app easily distributable on the World Wide Web:tm:

# NOTE
This project is a heavy WIP and is not usable yet.

See USAGE.md for information about how to use this.

## Why?
Writing documentation is already a boring process, and the documentation team may not have time to put into
distributing it in an easy-to-access format.

SpoonFeed takes care of that for you or your team. Focus on writing crystal clear documentation, in an easy-to-edit
format, and let SpoonFeed take care of the rest.

## Why "SpoonFeed"?
GitHub suggested `fictional-spoon` when creating the repo. No it's not a joke it's actually how it got this name.
